How OpenTox platform works?

1. The session is created by your app server. Your App server create a session in the OpenTok cloud via OpenTokRest API and receives the session id from the OpenTok cloud.
-  For now, think of session as a "room"

2. A client loads the app and server create a token
- The client gets session info such as token from app server

3. The client connects and begins streaming to the session
- The client uses the session id and token to establish a connection with the session(in OpenTok cloud)
- The client can publish an audio-video stream to the session.
- This is the same for the other client.
